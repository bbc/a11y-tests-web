# iPlayer Web Config

## Usage

As well as all the normal usage options, the iPlayer Web tests can be pointed at different `baseUrl`s using the `A11Y_IPLAYER_WEB_BASE_URL` environment variable. For example:


```
A11Y_CONFIG=iplayer-web/all A11Y_IPLAYER_WEB_BASE_URL=https://some.url npm run start:bbc-a11y
```
